                <h2>Colonial Williamsburg</h2>
                <p>Colonial Williamsburg is the restored and reconstructed historic area of Williamsburg, 
                    Virginia, a small city between the York and James rivers that was founded in 1632, designated 
                    capital of the English colony in 1698, and bestowed with a royal charter in 1722. It was a 
                    center of political activity before and during the American Revolution (1775‚Äì1783)‚Äîwhere 
                    George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Patrick Henry debated taxes, slavery, and the 
                    inalienable rights of men‚Äîand has since become the site of an ambitious restoration 
                    project launched in the 1930s and funded largely by the family of John D. Rockefeller Jr.
                    With many of its historic structures rebuilt and with ‚Äúinterpreters‚Äù reenacting 
                    eighteenth-century life, Colonial Williamsburg has become a landmark in the history of 
                    the American preservation movement. More than that, though, the project serves as a 
                    self-conscious shrine of American ideals. The history and legacy of slavery, once downplayed
                    at Williamsburg, is now dealt with openly‚Äîinterpreters are both white and African American‚Äîbut 
                    the focus remains on what the site‚Äôs originators called ‚Äúhealthful‚Äù information about democracy, 
                    freedom, and representative government.</p>

                    single goal: to make wines with great character. Blending a winemaker's passion for allowing varietals
                    to express themselves in each vintage with the art of gracious hospitality, the Winery celebrates 
                    the best of food and wine. Here, we share our enjoyment of wines, our stewardship of the land, our 
                    love of family and friends.In addition to the Winery, The Williamsburg Winery is also home to a 28-room
