    <main>
        <div class="design1">
            <h2>White Space & Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>Apple</h3>
            <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/?ref=land-book.com">apple.com</a>
            <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Mobile Screenshot of Apple Website">
            <p>Apple has always been know for it's sleek design and cleaness to their products. This also translates
                over to their website. It is so clean and so simple to use. It is soft to the eyes, yet still demands
                a users attention. The use of white space with the blackness of the site is fantasic. Just enough
                to give needed info, but not overbearing to be umcomfortable. 
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="design2">
            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3>Simply Chocolate</h3>
            <a href="https://simplychocolate.dk/">simplychocolate.dk</a>
            <img src="images/chocolate.jpg" alt="Mobile Screenshot of Simply Chocolate Website">
            <p>I think the most important part of this page, and the key element of the visual hierarchy of it
                is first the white bold text with a fantastic image behind it. Using the size of font helps tell 
                the user, hey look here first. The web page then prompts the user with half an image at the 
                bottom to scroll. This little image hint patterns throughout the entire website.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="design3">
            <h2>Hello</h2>
            <h3>Very Good Copy</h3>
            <a href="https://www.verygoodcopy.com/">verygoodcopy.com</a>
            <img src="images/VeryGood.jpg" alt="Mobile Screenshot of Very Good Copy Website">
            <p>This website really uses a lot of buttons and "hey look at me, and click me" type of design. It is
                very simple, easy to use. The call to action buttons are large enough to demand attention without unbalancing
                the visuals of the page.
